This is the website for my web consultancy, the goal of this site is to showcase my proficiencies, portfolio and have a future client(s) reach out for help.

You will find the image gallery and social media icons in the "gallery" link via the nav bar. There are also social media icons located via the "our team" page.

The client is anyone looking to enhance their current or future web presence.

The goal of the website is to have customers contact my company so we can help them achieve their web objectives.

I've implemented the necessary elements into this site but it has evolved/devolved in certain areas and gotten away from the theme. It may be time to put it out to pasture and start fresh.
